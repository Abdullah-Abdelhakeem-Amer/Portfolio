# Temporary Embedded Linux Image Placeholder
# This is a placeholder for embedded linux service images
# 
# Recommended image specifications:
# - Size: 1200x800 pixels
# - Format: JPG or PNG
# - Content: Linux terminal, embedded boards, Yocto build system, or real-time system graphs
# 
# Replace this file with actual embedded linux project images:
# - Custom Linux distributions
# - Embedded development boards
# - Real-time performance graphs
# - Yocto/Buildroot build environments
# 
# For now, you can use a stock image from:
# - Unsplash.com (search: "linux terminal embedded")
# - Pexels.com (search: "circuit board technology")
# - Or create a graphic with Tux penguin + embedded elements

# Temporary CSS background for development:
# background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FCC624 0%, #000000 100%);
# This creates a Linux-themed gradient background
